# what is Tree?
    => Node + Edges with parent & child relationship
    => we have root node which doesn't have parent and leaf nodes with no children

# Binart Tree (Two)?
    => In Binary Tree, every parent has at most 2 children (0,1,2)
    => Exactly 1 root
    => Exactly 1 path b/w root and any node
    => Single Node and No Node (Empty tree) is considered as binary tree 

# Binart Tree construction
    => we have a node which takes a value and left & right reference  
    => In case of empty child, we can use null or undefined
