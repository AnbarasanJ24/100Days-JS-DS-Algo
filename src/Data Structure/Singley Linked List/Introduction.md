# Linked List (COnsider when we do more insert and delete operation)

    # Its a DS which is used to store value, it contains head, tail and length
    # we cannot access value with index as like array
    # Linked List consists of nodes and each nodes have value and pointer to next node or null
    # Metaphor -> Array (Elevator) -> With index we can directly go to the place
                  Linked List (staircase) -> we need to start from then head to reach the place

# Comparison Array Vs Linked List

    # Linked List
        # Do not have indexes
        # Connected via nodes with a next pointer
        # Random access is not allowed
        # Insertion / Deletion is efficient then array
    # Array
        # Element arranged with index
        # Insertion and deletion can be expensive
        # Random access is easy
